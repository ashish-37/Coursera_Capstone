Amritsar and Delhi are the 2 popular cities in India . Both of these cities are located in North India. So, with this project we shall compare these 2 cities on the basis of the popular venues in these cities using the neighborhood data. By this project we shall see the similarities and dissimilarities between these 2 cities.This is a project that attempts to analyze the neighborhoods in each of these two cities and tries to understand what is popular in them and what they have to offer to someone who is contemplating to make a choice on seeking a life in either of the cities.The business problem in this study assumes that people who would be interested in this study are those who would like to create a projection of potential life and activities in the neighborhoods of the city if the subject moves to live in one of them.The decision to choose one over the other would depend on popular venues in the neighborhoods in each of these cities.
