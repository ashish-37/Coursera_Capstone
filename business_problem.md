Comparing 2 famous tourist places of India, Amritsar and Delhi . The aim of this project is to compare these two cities
on the basis of the venues in their neighborhoods and comparing them on the basis of the similarity between them.
The decision to choose one over the other would depend on popular venues in the neighborhoods in each of these cities.
These are a few of the questions to be answered in the notebook. We shall dive deep into the location data 
and data from Foursquare api.
